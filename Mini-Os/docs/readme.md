                    MINI OS UBUNTU
__________________________________________________________
PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Mini OS Ubuntu is a web project that simulates a mini Ubuntu-style operating system, built completely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The idea of the project is to recreate a real desktop experience directly inside the browser, including a top bar, a dock, and several mini functional apps.

This project is focused on practicing UI design, file structure, and OS-like interface simulation.

The interface has a dark Ubuntu-style theme, showing:

1. A top bar with the time in the center.
2. System icons aligned to the right side.
3. A bottom dock with:
